## Introduction

These repository contains a collectionof C programmes covering different conceptsalgorithms and problem solving approaches,These programmes are not Main to using production environment because they are not optimised and might not have error handling.

## Features

- Fundamental programming concepts.
- Basic error handling.
- Well-documented code.
- Memory management techniques.
- Modular program design.

## Installation

To get started with these C programs, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/production-ready-c-programs.git
cd production-ready-c-programs
```

## Usage

Each program is located in its own directory. To compile and run a program, navigate to its directory and use the following commands:

```sh
